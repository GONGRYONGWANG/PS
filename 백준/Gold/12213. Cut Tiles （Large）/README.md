### 문제 설명

<p>Enzo is doing renovation for his new house. The most difficult part is to buy exactly the right number of tiles. He wants <strong>N</strong> tiles of different sizes. Of course they have to be cut from the tiles he bought. All the required tiles are square. The lengths of side of the tiles are <strong>2</strong><strong><sup>S</sup></strong><strong><sub>1</sub></strong>, <strong>2</strong><strong><sup>S</sup></strong><strong><sub>2</sub></strong>, ..., <strong>2</strong><strong><sup>S</sup></strong><strong><sub>N</sub></strong>. He can only buy a lot of tiles sized <strong>M</strong>*<strong>M</strong>, and he decides to only cut tiles parallel to their sides for convenience. How many tiles does he need to buy?</p>

Each line start with the number <strong>N</strong> and <strong>M</strong>, indicating the number of required tiles and the size of the big tiles Enzo can buy. <strong>N</strong> numbers follow: <strong>S</strong><strong><sub>1</sub></strong>, <strong>S</strong><strong><sub>2</sub></strong>, ... <strong>S</strong><strong><sub>N</sub></strong>, showing the sizes of the required tiles.</p>
